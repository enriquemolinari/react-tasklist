# Task List App in React

Task List is a single page application built with React as part of my book [Understanding React](https://leanpub.com/understandingreact). It was build to demonstrate how to do authentication and authorization in a **secure** way.

The book is completely **free** for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).
